    # Identity
    id: Mapped[str] = mapped_column(String, primary_key=True)
    email: Mapped[str] = mapped_column(String, unique=True)
    hashed_password: Mapped[str] = mapped_column(String)
    
    # Profile
    first_name: Mapped[str] = mapped_column(String)
    last_name: Mapped[str] = mapped_column(String)
    airline: Mapped[str] = mapped_column(String)
    base: Mapped[str] = mapped_column(String)
    seat: Mapped[str] = mapped_column(String)  # FO, CA
    equipment: Mapped[List[str]] = mapped_column(JSON)
    
    # System
    created_at: Mapped[datetime] = mapped_column(DateTime)
    last_login: Mapped[Optional[datetime]] = mapped_column(DateTime)

## 🚨 Current Critical Issues (Night Work Priorities)

### Immediate Fixes Required:
1. **Remove PBS 2.0 References** - Update all docs and marketing copy
2. **Implement Edgier Design Theme** - Move away from generic styling
3. **Create Data Flow Visualization** - Technical diagram for marketing
4. **Connect Demo to Real Backend** - Make demo functional, not just simulation
5. **Complete Authentication Flow** - Full signup/login implementation

### Key Weaknesses Identified:
- ❌ PBS 2.0 terminology everywhere (user wants removed)
- ❌ Generic design system (need more distinctive, edgy styling)
- ❌ Disconnect between marketing pages and core app UI
- ❌ Demo is pure simulation (should connect to real APIs)
- ❌ No actual user management system
- ❌ Missing data flow visualization
