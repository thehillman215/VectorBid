# Overview

**ðŸ“… Last Updated**: August 18, 2025 - FastAPI Integration: Modern API endpoints with Flask compatibility for WSGI deployment

VectorBid is a Flask-based web application designed to help airline pilots analyze and rank trip bids. It allows pilots to upload schedule files, input natural language preferences, and receive AI-powered trip rankings utilizing OpenAI's GPT-4o model. The system now features a comprehensive, intelligent user experience with enhanced profile management, advanced preferences system with learning capabilities, smart dashboard with personalization, and a bid layer personas system offering 6 pre-built pilot flying styles (Family First, Money Maker, Commuter Friendly, Quality of Life, Reserve Avoider, Adventure Seeker). The project includes secure admin functionality for bid package management, one-click PBS command generation, and now provides professional-grade pilot operations interface with continuous preference optimization. The project aims to provide pilots with an intelligent tool for optimizing their monthly bid selections based on personal preferences, streamlining a complex and critical aspect of their profession.

# System Architecture

## Project Structure (Post-Refactor)
- **src/core/**: Flask application factory, database models, extensions
- **src/api/**: HTTP routes (main app) and admin endpoints with Bearer auth
- **src/auth/**: Replit OAuth integration and authentication utilities
- **src/lib/**: Business logic, services, schedule parsing, AI integration
- **src/ui/**: Jinja2 templates and frontend components
- **tests/**: Organized test suites (e2e/, legacy/, fixtures/)
- **archive/**: Historical files, documentation, samples
- **bids/**: Secure bid package storage with metadata

## Backend Architecture
- **Framework**: Flask web framework with FastAPI-style API endpoints for modern functionality
- **API Design**: RESTful API endpoints with JSON request/response handling, maintaining WSGI compatibility
- **Database**: PostgreSQL via SQLAlchemy ORM (for core data) and Replit DB (for user profiles)
- **Authentication**: Replit Auth integration with OAuth support
- **AI Integration**: OpenAI GPT-4o for intelligent trip ranking and PBS command generation
- **File Processing**: Multi-format schedule parsing (PDF via PyMuPDF, CSV, TXT)
- **Admin Features**: Complete administrative system with Bearer token authentication for uploading monthly bid packet PDFs, one-click validation preview with trip parsing, file storage management, and real-time upload status feedback.

## Frontend Architecture
- **Template Engine**: Jinja2 templates
- **Styling**: Bootstrap with dark theme, Font Awesome for icons
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach
- **Interactive Elements**: HTMX for dynamic content loading in the user onboarding wizard
- **Drag-and-Drop Interface**: Native HTML5 drag-and-drop API with visual feedback, real-time rank updates, and smooth animations for trip preference reordering.

## Data Storage
- **Primary Database**: PostgreSQL for main application data (e.g., ScheduleData, BidPacket).
- **User Profiles**: Replit DB for user profiles (airline, fleet, seat, base, seniority, personas, onboard status).
- **ORM**: SQLAlchemy for PostgreSQL interaction.

## Key Architectural Decisions
- **Database Design**: Uses PostgreSQL for robust, complex data and Replit DB for simplified user profile management.
- **Authentication Strategy**: Leverages Replit Auth for secure user authentication and session management.
- **API Architecture**: Hybrid Flask/FastAPI design providing modern REST API endpoints with FastAPI-style patterns while maintaining WSGI compatibility for deployment.
- **AI Integration Approach**: Utilizes OpenAI GPT-4o for natural language processing and intelligent trip analysis, enabling flexible preference input and human-like reasoning.
- **Enhanced File Processing**: Implements a multi-layered parsing system with block detection and pattern matching for complex airline bid packages (e.g., United Airlines format), including deferred PyMuPDF import for robustness.
- **Complete Pilot Workflow**: Features a comprehensive 3-step workflow: (1) Profile onboarding collecting airline, base, position, fleet, and seniority data, (2) Persona selection from 6 pre-built flying styles, and (3) Full 20-layer PBS bid strategy generation with expandable accordion interface showing strategy, probability, and PBS filters for each layer.
- **20-Layer PBS System**: Implements production-ready PBS 2.0 compliant bidding strategy with layers 1-5 (ideal conditions), 6-10 (good conditions), 11-15 (acceptable conditions), and 16-20 (fallback conditions), each with specific probability ratings and PBS command filters.
- **Automated Bid Package Matching**: Eliminates manual bid package selection; the system automatically matches pilots to appropriate bid packages based on their profile attributes (month, airline, aircraft, base, position), converting profile preferences into AI-ready strings for analysis.
- **One-Click Validation Preview**: Production-ready admin feature allowing instant bid package validation with trip parsing results, file details, sample data tables, and error handling through modal interface.
