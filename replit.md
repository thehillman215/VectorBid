# Overview

VectorBid is a Flask-based web application that helps airline pilots analyze and rank their trip bids based on personal preferences. The application allows pilots to upload their schedule files (PDF, CSV, or TXT format), input their preferences in natural language, and receive AI-powered rankings of available trips using OpenAI's GPT-4o model.

# User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## Key Architectural Decisions

### Database Design
- **Problem**: Need to store user data, OAuth tokens, and schedule analysis history
- **Solution**: SQLAlchemy ORM with PostgreSQL for robust data persistence
- **Rationale**: Provides strong consistency, complex querying capabilities, and integrates well with Flask

### Authentication Strategy
- **Problem**: Secure user authentication and session management
- **Solution**: Replit Auth integration with OAuth token storage
- **Rationale**: Leverages existing Replit infrastructure for seamless authentication

### AI Integration Approach
- **Problem**: Intelligent ranking of trips based on subjective preferences
- **Solution**: OpenAI GPT-4o with structured prompting for trip analysis
- **Rationale**: Natural language processing allows flexible preference input and provides human-like reasoning

### Enhanced File Processing Architecture (Updated: July 28, 2025)

- **Solution**: Multi-layered parsing system with block detection, pattern matching, and robust fallbacks
- **Features**:
  - Block-based trip extraction for structured documents
  - Enhanced regex patterns for United Airlines and similar formats
  - Support for date ranges (12NOV-15NOV), routing codes (IAH-SFO-IAH), and time formats (18:30)
  - Multiple parsing strategies with intelligent fallbacks
  - Improved weekend detection and duration calculation
- **Rationale**: Real airline schedules require sophisticated parsing to handle varied formatting, multi-line data, and airline-specific conventions

### Deferred PyMuPDF Import Architecture (Updated: July 30, 2025)
- **Problem**: PyMuPDF import errors could break the entire parser even when only CSV/TXT parsing was needed
- **Solution**: 
  - Refactored schedule_parser to use lazy loading of PyMuPDF
  - Moved `import fitz` inside `parse_pdf()` function to load only when PDF parsing is required
  - Maintained backward compatibility with existing `parse_schedule(bytes, filename)` interface
  - Added proper type hints and error handling for deferred imports
- **Benefits**: 
  - Application remains functional even if PyMuPDF dependencies are missing
  - Faster startup time when PDF parsing isn't needed
  - Better error isolation - PDF import failures don't affect CSV/TXT parsing
- **Testing**: All tests pass, including CSV parsing without PyMuPDF loaded
- **Status**: Production ready - robust parser with optional PDF support
