## ðŸš€ **What's New: AI-Powered Schedule Optimization**

VectorBid now features **the world's first LLM-guided optimization engine for airline pilot bidding**. This revolutionary system combines mathematical optimization with artificial intelligence to deliver:

- **Contextual Analysis**: AI understands real pilot concerns beyond mathematical scores
- **Personalized Recommendations**: Tailored advice based on pilot lifestyle and priorities  
- **Intelligent Trade-off Analysis**: Clear explanations of schedule decisions and alternatives
- **Future-Proof Bidding Strategy**: AI-generated advice for upcoming bid cycles

## ðŸ§  **How It Works**

### **Two-Stage Optimization Process**

```
Stage 1: Mathematical Optimization
â”œâ”€â”€ Traditional PBS optimization algorithms
â”œâ”€â”€ Constraint satisfaction and scoring
â””â”€â”€ Generate top candidate schedules

Stage 2: AI Enhancement  
â”œâ”€â”€ LLM analyzes mathematical results
â”œâ”€â”€ Considers pilot context and preferences
â”œâ”€â”€ Re-ranks based on holistic satisfaction
â””â”€â”€ Provides detailed explanations and insights
```
